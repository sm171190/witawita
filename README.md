What I think about when I think about - ...is not a slick name for a public repo on GitHub.It's an homage to HarukiMurakami's[book](https://www.amazon.com/What-About-Running-Vintage-International-ebook/dp/B0015DWJ8W/ref=sr_1_1?crid=E9WE8GW4OGCO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JspR-HDV8FJKSoKuSxmsIyHavxSuU-IYIvuEny_-YBJP91zxa8nXABS26or-a_-nv8KdsTli8Dleet7uHD9mRiZ7wVmxgOARDAd-RjPtC2MZKzSfiyZgx8z-WCskAgtzamfMap95VMhg2kWl7P2oe_vWzHnJ6zrPlXx4kEOnUUoriUsopCbyC87JVq1JJD_LvkWg8RPO1y3lUSOm_6vwwQ2b0HBpyye5Fz8_9Ol7KQ0.-gDIFwWlDy40HfNfU3V2steYPvaOuXzTPgMGqHwzask&dib_tag=se&keywords=what+i+think+about+when+i+think+about+running&qid=1753506157&sprefix=what+I+think%2Caps%2C323&sr=8-1) who in turn was inspired by Raymond Carver's [book](https://tinyurl.com/ypahf87n). Both are amazing books - worth a read. For each pdf I've also added the tex ang images, wherever possible. If you think something is missing or can be made better, clone and raise a Pull Request.
